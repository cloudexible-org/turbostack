## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **GitLab CI/CD Setup:** Added `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuring automated deployment to a self-hosted Docker runner.
- **Docker Compose Stack:** Added `docker-compose.yml` defining the Next.js app (`apps/www`), a local self-hosted Convex backend (`convex-backend`), and a Tailscale sidecar.
- **Next.js Standalone Dockerfile:** Added `apps/www/Dockerfile` using multi-stage builds and Next.js standalone mode.
- **Tailscale Sidecar configuration:** Configured automated Tailscale serving for the Next.js app on port 443 and TCP port forwarding to Convex backend on port 3210.
- **Convex Standalone Mode:** Updated `apps/www/next.config.ts` to output in standalone mode for optimized Docker builds.

### Changed
- **Optional Clerk Authentication:** Configured Clerk authentication to be completely optional. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is not defined, Clerk providers and components will be bypassed, rendering only a standard non-authenticated Convex UI.

### Fixed
- **TypeScript Error in Convex Auth:** Added a local declaration for `process` in `packages/api/convex/auth.config.ts` to resolve `Cannot find name 'process'` compiler errors during local development check.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Dependency Upgrade:** Bumped dependencies across the monorepo to the latest available versions, including `@clerk/nextjs` (v6 → v7), `vite` (v7 → v8), `@biomejs/biome` (v2.4.7), and others.
- Refactored `apps/www/app/page.tsx` to use the new `<Show>` component from Clerk v7, replacing deprecated `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` components.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-26

### Summary
Major monorepo restructuring: dropped React Native/Expo in favor of Capacitor-ready Vite app, split web presence into marketing site (www) and app (app).

### Added
- New `apps/app` — Vite + React + SWC + TypeScript SPA with service worker, fixed dev port 5173, and Tailwind CSS v4. Ready for Capacitor native builds.

### Changed
- **Renamed** `apps/web` → `apps/www` for marketing/landing pages (Next.js).
- **Removed** service worker from `apps/www` (push notifications moved to `apps/app`).
- **Dependency Upgrade:** Updated all core packages — Next.js 16.1.6, Convex 1.32.0, Tailwind CSS 4.2.1, Storybook 10.2.13, Playwright 1.58.2, Clerk 6.38.2, Base UI 1.2.0, Lucide 0.575.0, Biome 2.4.4.

### Removed
- `apps/native` (Expo/React Native app) — replaced by Capacitor strategy via `apps/app`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### Summary
TurboStack 1.0.0: A premium, production-ready monorepo for building type-safe applications with Next.js, Expo, Convex, and Clerk. Standardized on Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Base UI primitives, and the Biome toolchain.

### Added
- Feature cards for Biome Toolchain and Vercel Analytics Ready on the landing page.
- Comprehensive `AGENTS.md` guidelines for development standards.

### Changed
- **Version Upgrade:** Bumped all core packages to version `1.0.0`.
- **Dependency Refresh:** Updated all dependencies to their latest stable versions (Next.js 16, Convex 1.17+, Lucide 0.469+).
